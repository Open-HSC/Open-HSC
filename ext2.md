Note: The 2017 and 2024 syllabus is mostly the same so the content created would be applicable for everyone. 
Key differences lie in the Vectors topic, where 3D vectors is moved from Ext 2 to Ext 1 Maths in the 2024 syllabus, along with other minor syllabus changes.
As such, problems for the 2017 syllabus covering 3D vectors and vector proofs will be completed at a later stage if requested.
